    "text": "This translation is intended to supplement a work entitled “The Authoress of\nthe Odyssey”, which I published in 1897. I could not give the whole “Odyssey”\nin that book without making it unwieldy, I therefore epitomised my translation,\nwhich was already completed and which I now publish in full. I shall not here argue the two main points dealt with in the work just\nmentioned; I have nothing either to add to, or to withdraw from, what I have\nthere written. The points in question are: (1) that the “Odyssey” was written entirely at, and drawn entirely from, the\nplace now called Trapani on the West Coast of Sicily, alike as regards the\nPhaeacian and the Ithaca scenes; while the voyages of Ulysses, when once he is\nwithin easy reach of Sicily, solve themselves into a periplus of the island,\npractically from Trapani back to Trapani, via the Lipari islands, the Straits\nof Messina, and the island of Pantellaria.",

The main arguments on which I base the first of these somewhat startling\ncontentions, have been prominently and repeatedly before the English and\nItalian public ever since they appeared (without rejoinder) in the “Athenaeum”\nfor January 30 and February 20, 1892.

His son Antiphus had gone with Ulysses to Ilius, land of noble\nsteeds, but the savage Cyclops had killed him when they were all shut up in the\ncave, and had cooked his last dinner for him. [17] He had three sons left, of whom two\nstill worked on their father’s land, while the third, Eurynomus, was one of the\nsuitors; nevertheless their father could not get over the loss of Antiphus, and\nwas still weeping for him when he began his speech. “Men of Ithaca,” he said, “hear my words. From the day Ulysses left us there\nhas been no meeting of our councillors until now; who then can it be, whether\nold or young, that finds it so necessary to convene us? Has he got wind of some\nhost approaching, and does he wish to warn us, or would he speak upon some\nother matter of public moment?",

He stood in the middle of the assembly and\nthe good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then, turning to Aegyptius,\n“Sir,” said he, “it is I, as you will shortly learn, who have convened you, for\nit is I who am the most aggrieved. I have not got wind of any host approaching\nabout which I would warn you, nor is there any matter of public moment on which\nI would speak. My grievance is purely personal, and turns on two great\nmisfortunes which have fallen upon my house.",

The Achaeans will find you in everything—a ship and\na picked crew to boot—so that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news\nof your noble father.” “Antinous,” answered Telemachus, “I cannot eat in peace, nor take pleasure of\nany kind with such men as you are.

One can soon see when a man is son to one\nwhom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and offspring—and it has blessed\nNestor from first to last all his days, giving him a green old age in his own\nhouse, with sons about him who are both well disposed and valiant. We will put\nan end therefore to all this weeping, and attend to our supper again. Let water\nbe poured over our hands. Telemachus and I can talk with one another fully in\nthe morning.” On this Asphalion, one of the servants, poured water over their hands and they\nlaid their hands on the good things that were before them. Then Jove’s daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She drugged the\nwine with an herb that banishes all care, sorrow, and ill humour. Whoever\ndrinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear all the rest of the day, not\neven though his father and mother both of them drop down dead, or he sees a\nbrother or a son hewn in pieces before his very eyes.",

So she gave him a great bronze axe that suited his hands; it was\nsharpened on both sides, and had a beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on\nto it. She also gave him a sharp adze, and then led the way to the far end of\nthe island where the largest trees grew—alder, poplar and pine, that reached\nthe sky—very dry and well seasoned, so as to sail light for him in the water. [53] Then, when she\nhad shown him where the best trees grew, Calypso went home, leaving him to cut\nthem, which he soon finished doing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed\nthem smooth, squaring them by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile\nCalypso came back with some augers, so he bored holes with them and fitted the\ntimbers together with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled\nshipwright makes the beam of a large vessel, and he fixed a deck on top of the\nribs, and ran a gunwale all round it.",

Then, as one who lives alone in the country, far from any\nneighbor, hides a brand as fire-seed in the ashes to save himself from having\nto get a light elsewhere, even so did Ulysses cover himself up with leaves; and\nMinerva shed a sweet sleep upon his eyes, closed his eyelids, and made him lose\nall memories of his sorrows. So here Ulysses slept, overcome by sleep and toil; but Minerva went off to the\ncountry and city of the Phaeacians—a people who used to live in the fair town\nof Hypereia, near the lawless Cyclopes.

A maid servant then brought him water in a\nbeautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for him to wash his\nhands, and she drew a clean table beside him; an upper servant brought him\nbread and offered him many good things of what there was in the house, and\nUlysses ate and drank. Then Alcinous said to one of the servants, “Pontonous,\nmix a cup of wine and hand it round that we may make drink-offerings to Jove\nthe lord of thunder, who is the protector of all well-disposed suppliants.” Pontonous then mixed wine and water, and handed it round after giving every man\nhis drink-offering. When they had made their offerings, and had drunk each as\nmuch as he was minded, Alcinous said: “Aldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians, hear my words.

When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears from his eyes,\nuncovered his face, and, taking his cup, made a drink-offering to the gods; but\nwhen the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus to sing further, for they delighted in\nhis lays, then Ulysses again drew his mantle over his head and wept bitterly. No one noticed his distress except Alcinous, who was sitting near him, and\nheard the heavy sighs that he was heaving. So he at once said, “Aldermen and\ntown councillors of the Phaeacians, we have had enough now, both of the feast,\nand of the minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us proceed therefore\nto the athletic sports, so that our guest on his return home may be able to\ntell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as boxers, wrestlers,\njumpers, and runners.”",

There are\ntwelve chief men among you, and counting myself there are thirteen; contribute,\neach of you, a clean cloak, a shirt, and a talent of fine gold; let us give him\nall this in a lump down at once, so that when he gets his supper he may do so\nwith a light heart. As for Euryalus he will have to make a formal apology and a\npresent too, for he has been rude.” Thus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying, and sent their\nservants to fetch the presents. Then Euryalus said, “King Alcinous, I will give\nthe stranger all the satisfaction you require. He shall have my sword, which is\nof bronze, all but the hilt, which is of silver. I will also give him the\nscabbard of newly sawn ivory into which it fits.",

This will stop them from\nescorting people in future; and I should also like to bury their city under a\nhuge mountain.” “My good friend,” answered Jove, “I should recommend you at the very moment\nwhen the people from the city are watching the ship on her way, to turn it into\na rock near the land and looking like a ship.

But Eumaeus called to\nhis men and said, “Bring in the best pig you have, that I may sacrifice him for\nthis stranger, and we will take toll of him ourselves.

Then he clubbed the pig\nwith a billet of oak which he had kept back when he was chopping the firewood,\nand stunned it, while the others slaughtered and singed it.

It came quite close up to\nthem and flew away on their right hands in front of the horses.

Therefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I\nhave, and has nothing to fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course, if death\ncomes to him from the gods, he cannot escape it.” He said this to quiet her,\nbut in reality he was plotting against Telemachus.

Telemachus was the first to speak. “So you have got back, Eumaeus,” said he. “What is the news of the town?

The servants brought him a portion of meat, and an\nupper woman servant set bread before him that he might eat. Presently Ulysses\nand the swineherd came up to the house and stood by it, amid a sound of music,\nfor Phemius was just beginning to sing to the suitors. Then Ulysses took hold\nof the swineherd’s hand, and said: “Eumaeus, this house of Ulysses is a very fine place. No matter how far you go,\nyou will find few like it. One building keeps following on after another. The\nouter court has a wall with battlements all round it; the doors are double\nfolding, and of good workmanship; it would be a hard matter to take it by force\nof arms.",

Will you go inside first and join\nthe suitors, leaving me here behind you, or will you wait here and let me go in\nfirst? But do not wait long, or some one may see you loitering about outside,\nand throw something at you. Consider this matter I pray you.” And Ulysses answered, “I understand and heed.

As for\nbread, you can get enough of that to fill your belly, by begging about the\ntown, and letting those give that will.”",

Is he afraid that\nsome one will ill-treat him, or is he shy of coming inside the house at all? Beggars should not be shamefaced.” To this you answered, O swineherd Eumaeus, “The stranger is quite reasonable. He is avoiding the suitors, and is only doing what any one else would do.",

Then he went up to Telemachus and said in his ear so that\nnone could overhear him, “My dear sir, I will now go back to the pigs, to see\nafter your property and my own business.

Presently he soared off into the sky, and left them lying dead about the yard;\nwhereon I wept in my dream till all my maids gathered round me, so piteously\nwas I grieving because the eagle had killed my geese. Then he came back again,\nand perching on a projecting rafter spoke to me with human voice, and told me\nto leave off crying.",

The\ngeese are the suitors, and I am no longer an eagle, but your own husband, who\nam come back to you, and who will bring these suitors to a disgraceful end.’ On\nthis I woke, and when I looked out I saw my geese at the trough eating their\nmash as usual.” “This dream, Madam,” replied Ulysses, “can admit but of one interpretation, for\nhad not Ulysses himself told you how it shall be fulfilled? The death of the\nsuitors is portended, and not one single one of them will escape.”",

By and by the women returned from the fountain, and the\nswineherd came after them with the three best pigs he could pick out. These he\nlet feed about the premises, and then he said good-humouredly to Ulysses,\n“Stranger, are the suitors treating you any better now, or are they as insolent\nas ever?” “May heaven,” answered Ulysses, “requite to them the wickedness with which they\ndeal high-handedly in another man’s house without any sense of shame.” Thus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthius the goatherd came up, for he too\nwas bringing in his best goats for the suitors’ dinner; and he had two\nshepherds with him. They tied the goats up under the gatehouse, and then\nMelanthius began gibing at Ulysses. “Are you still here, stranger,” said he,\n“to pester people by begging about the house? Why can you not go elsewhere? You\nand I shall not come to an understanding before we have given each other a\ntaste of our fists.",

Then a third man,\nPhiloetius, joined them, who was bringing in a barren heifer and some goats. These were brought over by the boatmen who are there to take people over when\nany one comes to them. So Philoetius made his heifer and his goats secure under\nthe gatehouse, and then went up to the swineherd. “Who, Swineherd,” said he,\n“is this stranger that is lately come here? Is he one of your men? What is his\nfamily? Where does he come from? Poor fellow, he looks as if he had been some\ngreat man, but the gods give sorrow to whom they will—even to kings if it so\npleases them.”",

But the rest stayed where they were, for the speech of\nHalitherses displeased them, and they sided with Eupeithes; they therefore\nhurried off for their armour, and when they had armed themselves, they met\ntogether in front of the city, and Eupeithes led them on in their folly. He\nthought he was going to avenge the murder of his son, whereas in truth he was\nnever to return, but was himself to perish in his attempt. Then Minerva said to Jove, “Father, son of Saturn, king of kings, answer me\nthis question—What do you propose to do? Will you set them fighting still\nfurther, or will you make peace between them?” And Jove answered, “My child, why should you ask me? Was it not by your own\narrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge upon the suitors?",
